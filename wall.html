            content="Displays an interactive wall and turnstile. The possible
            interactions are as follows. Pressing ‘q’: the turnstile doors
            rotate a small angle around the pole and the walls remain
            stationary (can be done repeatedly). Pressing ‘p’: the walls
            rotate a small angle around the turnstile and the turnstile doors
            remain stationary (can be done repeatedly). Pressing ‘r’: all
            objects (except for the camera) are returned to their initial
            state. Pressing ‘0’: the camera is positioned at its initial
            position in the upper right corner closest to the viewer. Pressing
            ‘1’: moves the camera to the upper right corner farthest from the
            viewer. Pressing ‘2’: the camera is positioned at the vertical and
            horizontal center of the scene and directed at the front of the
            wall.">
